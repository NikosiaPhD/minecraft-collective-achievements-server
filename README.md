# Collective Minecraft Achievements Server

This is a simple python server that receives updates from the **Collective Minecraft Achievements Plugin** (TODO: add link) and creates a visual list that can be shown in OBS.

It is a lot trickier to set up and not necessary if you are happy with tracking progress just in minecraft chat.



## Contact, Future Plans, etc.

You are free to use and modify this for your own stream. Instead of sharing the code with anyone ("redistribution"), refer them to this github repository. 

Feel free to contact me with suggestions or questions.

Features I want to add at some point:
- use TextFit to fit longer achievement titles, requirement names, or descriptions
- add confetti particles when something gets unlocked
